# About
Welcome to ReviewItAPI, a REST api and Frontend for everyday people to make real reviews for real products, intended to be a user driven way for users to track products and get authentic ratings and reviews. The api includes a variety of functionality to provide operations, and ergonomic RESTful endpoints for any sort of front-end, be it mobile, desktop, or web.

# Frontend
The frontend was created using Angular, with bootstrap CSS for styling. My favorite component to implement is the display filtering component as it adds a lot of dimensionality to the user experience. I did this by using tools with Angular like @Input and @Output decorators to keep the component seperate for organizational purposes, while still maintaining excellent communication between components.

# Backend
The backend is supported by an SQL database, and a Spring Boot server infrastructure using Java. The backend features controller, service, and data layers. To communicate data between the controller and service layers data transfer objects (DTOs) are used, this also further increases modularity of the system. The API endpoints are designed to be ergonomic and dynamic to support a fluid and engaging user experience.

# Lessons learned
I learned a lot about Angular and how to leverage its many excellent tools during this project. It was a great opportunity to dive deep into architecting an Angular app and modularizing with components, services, interceptors, and more. During this project I also learned a lot about creating a clean and responsive UI that enhances the user experience.
