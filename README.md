# Lessons learned
I learned a lot about reducing boilerplate and thinking creatively to do so. I love solving problems, and I really dont like boilerplate, so its a win-win! I also learned a lot about the importance of clean consistent patterns and naming, that is an art, and really keeps a project together.
